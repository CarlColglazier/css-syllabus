## Two trends in computing

At one point computers were large, expensive, and rare.

## Two trends in computing

Computers are getting smaller and cheaper.

# How have the social sciences changed alongside the rise of computers?

## Methods

+ Advances in computationally expensive statistical techniques such as Bayesian inference [@fienbergWhenDidBayesian2006 p. 24]
+ Changes in collaborative patterns between scientists, though not necessarily an increase in productivity [@goldsteinCommunicationCostsScience2023]

## Data

+ Trace data allow us to observe existing social processes at scale [@kingEnsuringDataRichFuture2011]
+ New communication methods create new areas of study [@boydSocialNetworkSites2007]

##

So we have

1. A lot more data on social processes; and
2. The computational power to analyze it.
