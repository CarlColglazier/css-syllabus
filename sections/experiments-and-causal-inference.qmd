You have have heard the phrase "correlation does not imply causation". This is usually used to say that just because two variables are associated with each other, that does not mean one causes each other. [This website](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) can generate spurious correlations for you.

So if correlation does not imply causation, how do we establish causation? Generally, we use experiments. For example, in medicine, we might test the effectiveness of a new drug by running a randomized control trial (RCT). People are split into a _treatment_ group, where they receive the drug, and a control group, where they do not receive the drug. Assuming that the group was randomized correctly, the we can attribute the difference in outcomes between the two groups to the drug.

Ideally we would be able to have experiments for everything, but this is not always practical. Causal inference gives us tools to answer _why_ questions when we cannot use randomized control trials.

The _fundamental problem of causal inference_ is that we cannot observe both a treated unit and its untreated counterfactual at the same time. The goal of causal inference approaches to provide a framework to answer causal questions regardless.

Some popular techniques include:

+ Matching: find other units with similar characteristics.
