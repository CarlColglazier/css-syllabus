title: Simulations and Agent-based Models (ABMs)
order: 3
description: How can we use computer simulations to study social phenomena from the "buttom up"?
full-description: >-
  We discuss the role of simulations and when they may be useful in the development and explanation of theories or in forecasting.

Previously, we introduced prediction, explaination, and causality as important parts of the scientific process. Here, we introduce yet another one: simulation.

Why might we care about simulating processes?

Writing outline:

- role of theory
- from the ground up
- areas where getting observational data may be impractical or unethical
- are we just making stuff up? how can we validate?
