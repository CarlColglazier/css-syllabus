Previously, we introduced prediction, explaination, and causality as important parts of the scientific process. Here, we introduce yet another one: simulation.

Why might we care about simulating processes?

Writing outline:

- role of theory
- from the ground up
- areas where getting observational data may be impractical or unethical
- are we just making stuff up? how can we validate?
